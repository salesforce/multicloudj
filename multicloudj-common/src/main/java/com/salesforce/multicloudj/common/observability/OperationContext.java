/**
 * Per-operation observability context attached to SDK requests.
 *
 * <p>Carries three optional identifiers used to correlate SDK activity with the caller's own
 * logs, traces, and audit records:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code correlationId} — identifies a single logical request. If not supplied, the SDK
 *       generates a UUID and echoes it back on the response so the caller can correlate.
 *   <li>{@code tenantId} — identifies the tenant on whose behalf the operation runs. Never
 *       auto-generated; never echoed back.
 *   <li>{@code serviceId} — identifies the calling service. Never auto-generated; never echoed
 *       back.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When present, each identifier is set as a span attribute and MDC entry for the duration of
 * the operation. On upload, providers additionally stamp them onto the stored object's metadata
 * (under {@code sdk-logging-*} keys) so cloud audit logs can be traced back to the originating
 * request, tenant, and service.
